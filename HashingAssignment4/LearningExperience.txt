In this assignment I learned a few things:
1) Implementation of an array of linkedlists
2) calculation implementation of hash table size and required index
3) How to read input of a text file
4) implementation of separate chaining
I would not do anything different next time. The project was quite confusing and a pain to deal with because there was no javadoc provided. 
However, I was able to figure out what to do with the help of class notes and some extra effort. Looking forward to the next assignment.

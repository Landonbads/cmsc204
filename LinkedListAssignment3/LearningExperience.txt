Assignment3 has made me learn to never procrastinate programming assignments, no matter how easy the assignment may seem. I thought I could just power through the project the last 2 days but it did not work out in my favor. Many bugs popped up that I was not expecting and I had a midterm for another class I had to study for. So, I was forced to turn in this assignment almost a day late and risk a zero grade. I will be starting the next assignment as soon as it's assigned.
